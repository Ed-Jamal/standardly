Thank you for considering contributing your time and brilliance to standardly. We welcome your contributions in the form of issues or code. But before we may accept any of those, we request you to kindly do the following:

### Be courteous
At Intuit, we take our engineering open source code of conduct seriously. Please take a moment to read our [code of conduct](https://opensource.intuit.com/#coc) before you create any pull request or issue.

### DRY : Please do not repeat yourself. 
Make sure you have checked the list of open issues and ensure that the issue is not already covered by an existing one. Our issue and pr templates are not mere suggestions. Please fill in whatever is applicable - if something is not applicable, please say so, rather than just leave it empty - this way we know that you actually care.

### Pull Requests
We will review your pull requests and get back to you - our timeline for response will be displayed as a comment in the description area of the pull request when you create one. 
- Pull requests without an associated issue could be categorically rejected. So please pay attention that your pr actually solves an real issue. 
- They must also describe your approach to the problem and any other information you can give regarding your solution. 
- Make sure that your tests are adequate and actually pass. 
- Ensure merge conflicts are resolved before you request for a review.
